# Design Patterns For iOS Development

_This article is informative and does not have the purpose to strictly motivate developers to follow this patterns for the development of iOS applications. However, it might be a good idea to understand them and considering using them for your particular problems._

### Types of Design Patterns.

1. **Structural**: Describe how objects are combined and composed to create complex structures. 
- MVC
- MVVM

2. **Behavioral**: Describe how objects communicate with each other.
- Delegation
- Strategy
- Observer

3. **Creational**: Describe how to create or instantiate objects.
- Builder
- Singleton
- Prototype

## Class Diagrams

As in this article, class diagrams are very useful for understanding Design patterns, so let's go through the require concepts that you already might be familiar with.

Class Diagrams include Classes, protocols, properties, methods and relationships.

Here is a class that we called Dog and a subclass SheepDog, in a class diagrams instead of saying _SheepDog inherits from Dog_ we can simply say _SheepDog is a Dog_. Makes sense right? The direction of the arrow defines de relationship. The arrows always point at the super class.

<img src="./resources/01.png" width="150"/> 

To indicate that a class has a property, we can use a plain arrow and it would be read as "has a". If there are multiple properties it could be read as "has one or more.."

<img src="./resources/02.png" width="200"/> 

Also, we could indicate multiple relationships in a single diagram.

<img src="./resources/03.png" width="300"/> 

Now, when we define a protocol, the right way would be adding a label "Protocol" surrounded by double brackets. 

<img src="./resources/04.png" width="150"/> 

This is the way we could add a class diagram to define a class that implements OR conforms to a protocol. 

<img src="./resources/05.png" width="150"/> 

But hold on. If we want to indicate "uses", we use a plain arrow and a dashed line. This is a relationship for **usage**, which means that indicates its purpose. 

<img src="./resources/06.png" height="90"/> 

We can add also add methods and properties in a class diagram.

<img src="./resources/07.png" height="150"/> 

Here it is a complete class diagram for a Farmer who has a SheepDog which is a Dog that delegates to the PetOwning object.

<img src="./resources/08.png" height="200"/> 

### Other Examples

1. Dog and Cat inherit from Animal, which defines an eat method.

<img src="./resources/09.png" height="150"/> 

2. Vehicle protocol has one Motor and one or more Wheel objects. Note that since the vehicle has one or more wheels an 1...* is added.

<img src="./resources/10.png" height="150"/> 

3. Professor is a teacher and conforms to a Person protocol. This is a bit ambiguous, so there could be two options. In the option 1 the Professor conforms to Person and Teacher also conforms to Person. In Option 2 Teacher does not conforms to Person.

Option 1 | Option 2
------------ | -------------

## MVC (Model-View-Controller)

The MVC separates data into 3 types:

<img src="./resources/13.png" height="200"/> 
<pre>
MVC is the Apple design pattern in the UIKit.
</pre>

- **Model**: Models hold onto application data. Usually Structs or simple classes.
- **Views**: Display visual elements and controls on the screen. Usually subclasses of UIView.
- **Controller**: Coordinates between Model and Views. Usually subclasses of UIViewController.

### Some rules
* Controllers are allowed to hold strong properties for the Model or View so they can access directly.
* Controllers might have one or more Models and/or Views.
* Models and Views should not hold a strong reference of the ViewController. Instead Model communicate to the Controllers through Property Observers and Views communicate to Controller by IBActions. 
* Models and Views are meant to be reusable, but Controllers not because Controllers have specific logic.

The following is a basic example where we illustrate what has been said. The Model is a basic struct that holds the data. A view could be any subclass of UIView, it is reusable. The View Controller holds a strong reference of the Model and the View, but no one owns it. The communication between the components is clear. The controller modifies the view and the model directly. The View talks to the Controller by IBActions, the View Could talk to the Controller by observers or delegates, but it will come later in this article.

```
// MARK: - Model
public struct Address {
  public var street: String
  public var city: String
  public var state: String
  public var zipCode: String
}

// MARK: - View
public final class AddressView: UIView {
  @IBOutlet public var streetTextField: UITextField!
  @IBOutlet public var cityTextField: UITextField!
  @IBOutlet public var stateTextField: UITextField!
  @IBOutlet public var zipCodeTextField: UITextField!
}

// MARK: - Controller
public final class AddressViewController: UIViewController {
  
  // MARK: - Properties
  public var address: Address? {
    didSet {
      updateViewFromAddress()
    }
  }
  public var addressView: AddressView! {
    guard isViewLoaded else { return nil }
    return (view as! AddressView)
  }
  
  // MARK: - View Lifecycle
  public override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    updateViewFromAddress()
  }
  
  private func updateViewFromAddress() {
    guard let addressView = addressView,
      let address = address else { return }
    addressView.streetTextField.text = address.street
    addressView.cityTextField.text = address.city
    addressView.stateTextField.text = address.state
    addressView.zipCodeTextField.text = address.zipCode
  }
  
  // MARK: - Actions
  @IBAction public func updateAddressFromView(_ sender: AnyObject) {
    guard let street = addressView.streetTextField.text, street.count > 0,
      let city = addressView.cityTextField.text, city.count > 0,
      let state = addressView.stateTextField.text, state.count > 0,
      let zipCode = addressView.zipCodeTextField.text, zipCode.count > 0
      else {
        // TO-DO: show an error message, handle the error, etc
        return
    }
    address = Address(street: street, city: city,
                      state: state, zipCode: zipCode)
  }
}

```

### Considerations

```
- Not every object fits into Model, View or Controller.
- Be careful about controllers growing too big.
- Use other patterns as needed.
```
---
## Delegation Pattern

<pre>
ðŸ¥Ž This pattern enables an object to use another helper object to provide data or perform a task rather than doing it itself.
ðŸ¥Ž The core purpose of the delegate pattern is to allow an object to communicate back to its owner in a decoupled way. By not requiring an object to know the concrete type of its owner, we can write code that is much easier to reuse and maintain.
</pre>

The delegation pattern has 3 parts:
- **Delegating Object:** The object that has the Delegate. The delegate is usually held in the delegating object as **weak property** to avoid a retain cycle where the delegating object retains the delegate which retains the delegating object.
- **Delegate Protocol:** Defines the methods that the Delegate might implement. 
- **Delegate:** The Helper Object that implements the Delegate Protocol.

<img src="./resources/14.png" height="100"/> 

### Basic example
```
// MARK: - Delegate
public class MainViewController: UIViewController {
    public override func viewDidLoad() {
        // Instantiate a MainViewController
        let vc = MenuViewController()
        vc.delegate = self
        navigationController?.pushViewController(vc, animated: true)
    }
}
extension MainViewController: MenuViewControllerDelegate {
    public func menuViewController(didRequestAFavour index: Int) {
        // Here I use index and do some task for MenuViewController.
    }
}

// MARK: - Delegate Protocol
public protocol MenuViewControllerDelegate: class {
    func menuViewController(didRequestAFavour index: Int)
}

// MARK: - Delegating Object
public class MenuViewController: UIViewController {

  public weak var delegate: MenuViewControllerDelegate?

  @IBAction public func updateAddressFromView(_ sender: AnyObject) {
    delegate?.menuViewController(didRequestAFavour: 1)
  }
}
```

### When should we use it?

1. To break up large classes or create reusable components.
2. In Apple frameworks datasources and delagates both use this pattern. (FYI, Datasources have delegate methods to **provide** data and delegates have delegates methods that **receive** data).
---
## Strategy Pattern

<pre>
ðŸ¥Ž This pattern defines a family of interchangeable objects that can be set or switch at runtime.
ðŸ¥Ž This pattern is similar to the Delegate pattern but, instead of defining one delegate we have a family of objects.
</pre>

<img src="./resources/15.png" width="300"/> 

This pattern has 3 parts.

1. **The object using the strategy:** Usually is a ViewController or any class that requires interchangeable behavior.
2. **Strategy Protocol:** Protocol that define the methods of the strategy.
3. **Strategies:** Objects that conform to the Strategy Protocol.

### When should we use it?

- When we have two or more interchangeable behaviors.
- When we need to interchange them at runtime.

### Basic Example

The following example shows this pattern in action, basically the strategies are helper classes that conform to the same protocol which means that the protocol methods will be the same but the logic in each strategy is different according to the needs. 

```
// MARK: - Strategy Protocol
public protocol MovieRatingStrategy {
  
  var ratingServiceName: String { get }
  
  func fetchRating(for movieTitle: String,
                   success: (_ rating: String, _ review: String) -> ())
}

// MARK: - Strategy 1
public class RottenTomatoesClient: MovieRatingStrategy {
  public let ratingServiceName = "Rotten Tomatoes"
  
  public func fetchRating(
    for movieTitle: String,
    success: (_ rating: String, _ review: String) -> ()) {
    
    // In a real service, you'd make a network request...
    // Here, we just provide dummy values...
    let rating = "95%"
    let review = "It rocked!"
    success(rating, review)
  }
}

// MARK: - Strategy 2
public class IMDbClient: MovieRatingStrategy {
  public let ratingServiceName = "IMDb"
  
  public func fetchRating(
    for movieTitle: String,
    success: (_ rating: String, _ review: String) -> ()) {
    
    let rating = "3 / 10"
    let review = """
      It was terrible! The audience was throwing rotten
      tomatoes!
      """
    success(rating, review)
  }
}

import UIKit

// MARK: - Object Using the Strategy
public class MoviewRatingViewController: UIViewController {
  
  // MARK: - Properties
  public var movieRatingClient: MovieRatingStrategy!
  
  // MARK: - Outlets
  @IBOutlet public var movieTitleTextField: UITextField!
  @IBOutlet public var ratingServiceNameLabel: UILabel!
  @IBOutlet public var ratingLabel: UILabel!
  @IBOutlet public var reviewLabel: UILabel!
  
  // MARK: - View Lifecycle
  public override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    ratingServiceNameLabel.text =
      movieRatingClient.ratingServiceName
  }
  
  // MARK: - Actions
  @IBAction public func searchButtonPressed(sender: Any) {
    guard let movieTitle = movieTitleTextField.text
      else { return }
    
    movieRatingClient.fetchRating(for: movieTitle) {
      (rating, review) in
      self.ratingLabel.text = rating
      self.reviewLabel.text = review
    }
  }
}
```

---
## Singleton Pattern

<pre>
ðŸ¥Ž This pattern restricts a class to a single instance. Every reference to the class refers to the same underlined instance.
</pre>

<img src="./resources/16.png" width="200"/> 

### When should we use it?

- When it makes sense to have a shared instance of the same class alive all the time and available from any other class.
- Sometimes is useful to store states on memory while using the application and not on disk.
- Sometimes is useful to have share instance but with a bit of difference. In this case a singleton with custom instances capability could be created. This is called Singleton Plus.

### Basic Example

```
// MARK: - Singleton
public class MySingleton {
  static let shared = MySingleton()
  private init() { }
}

let mySingleton = MySingleton.shared


// MARK: - Singleton Plus

public class MySingletonPlus {
  static let shared = MySingletonPlus()
  public init() { }
}

let singletonPlus = MySingletonPlus.shared
let singletonPlus2 = MySingletonPlus()
```

### Cautions

- Be careful, this pattern is very easy to be overused. **Don't make it the first option to accomplish a task.**
- Don't use it for passing data.
- Singletons make testing harder.
- Be aware of "code smells" indicating you don't need a singleton.
- Singleton Plus might not be a good idea. Consider using simple class objects.
___

## Memento Pattern

<pre>
ðŸ¥Ž This pattern allows an object to be saved and restored.
</pre>

<img src="./resources/17.png" height="100"/> 

This patters has 3 parts.
- **Originator:** Is the object to be saved or restored.
- **Memento:** Represents a stored state.
- **Care Taker:** Is responsible for persisting the memento and later on providing the memento back to the originator to restore the originator's state.

### Usage 

- Used to save and restore an object. For example, to implement a "save game" system.
- By persisting an array of mementos, undo/redo stacks can me implemented.

### Basic Example

```
// MARK: - Originator
public class Game: Codable {
  
  public class State: Codable {
    public var attemptsRemaining: Int = 3
    public var level: Int = 1
    public var score: Int = 0
  }
  public var state = State()
  
  public func rackUpMassivePoints() {
    state.score += 9002
  }
  
  public func monstersEatPlayer() {
    state.attemptsRemaining -= 1
  }
}

// MARK: - Memento
typealias GameMemento = Data

// MARK: - CareTaker
public class GameSystem {
  
  private let decoder = JSONDecoder()
  private let encoder = JSONEncoder()
  private let userDefaults = UserDefaults.standard
  
  public func save(_ game: Game, title: String) throws {
    let data = try encoder.encode(game)
    userDefaults.set(data, forKey: title)
  }
  
  public func load(title: String) throws -> Game {
    guard let data = userDefaults.data(forKey: title),
      let game = try? decoder.decode(Game.self, from: data)
      else {
        throw Error.gameNotFound
    }
    return game
  }
  
  public enum Error: String, Swift.Error {
    case gameNotFound
  }
}

// MARK: - Example
var game = Game()
game.monstersEatPlayer()
game.rackUpMassivePoints()

// Save Game
let gameSystem = GameSystem()
try gameSystem.save(game, title: "Best Game Ever")

// New Game
game = Game()
print("New Game Score: \(game.state.score)")

// Load Game
game = try! gameSystem.load(title: "Best Game Ever")
print("Loaded Game Score: \(game.state.score)")
```
___
## Observer Pattern

<pre>
ðŸ¥Ž This pattern allows an object to observe changes on another object. Apple added support for this pattern in Swift 5.1 with the additional Publisher in the Combine framework.
</pre>

<img src="./resources/18.png" height="100"/> 

These are the types involved in this pattern:
- **Subscriber:** The Observer object that receives updates.
- **Publisher:** The Observable object that sends updates.
- **Value:** The object that is changed.

### Basic Example

```
import Combine

// MARK: - Publisher
public class User {
    // MARK: - Value
    @Published var name: String
    public init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

// MARK: - Subscriber
let user = User(name: "Ray")
let publisher = user.$name
var subscriber: AnyCancellable? = publisher.sink() {
    print("User's name is \($0)")
}

user.name = "Vicki"
// Set subscriber to nul to stop receiving changes
subscriber = nil
user.name = "Ray has left the building"
```
### Considerations
- @Published annotations can be added only in a class type.
- Don't use on simple models or properties that never change.
- Be sure about what to expect to change and when.
___
## Builder Pattern

<pre>
ðŸ¥Ž This pattern allows us to create complex objects by providing inputs step by step instead of requiring all the inputs upfront in the initializer.
ðŸ¥Ž Use it when building a product that requires multiple inputs. 
ðŸ¥Ž If the product does have several inputs or cannot be created step by step it is better to use convenient initializers with default values.
</pre>

<img src="./resources/19.png" height="230"/> 

This pattern involved 3 types.
- **Director:** Accepts inputs and coordinates with the builder. Usually a view controller or a helper class that is used by the view controller.
- **Product:** The complex object to be created. Could be a class or a struct.
- **Builder:** Accepts step by step inputs and handles the creations of the products.

### Basic Example

The following example shows this pattern in action for a hamburger builder where the director is a chef or employee and the product is a builder. The builder object is contains the logic required to deliver fresh and delicious hamburgers. In this way the hamburger object is isolated from the complex logic that required preparing a nice burger.

```
// MARK: - Product
public struct Hamburger {
  public let meat: Meat
  public let sauce: Sauces
  public let toppings: Toppings
}

extension Hamburger: CustomStringConvertible {
  public var description: String {
    return meat.rawValue + " burger"
  }
}

public enum Meat: String {
  case beef
  case chicken
  case kitten
  case tofu
}

public struct Sauces: OptionSet {
  public static let mayonnaise = Sauces(rawValue: 1 << 0)
  public static let mustard = Sauces(rawValue: 1 << 1)
  public static let ketchup = Sauces(rawValue: 1 << 2)
  public static let secret = Sauces(rawValue: 1 << 3)
  
  public let rawValue: Int
  public init(rawValue: Int) {
    self.rawValue = rawValue
  }
}

public struct Toppings: OptionSet {
  public static let cheese = Toppings(rawValue: 1 << 0)
  public static let lettuce = Toppings(rawValue: 1 << 1)
  public static let pickles = Toppings(rawValue: 1 << 2)
  public static let tomatoes = Toppings(rawValue: 1 << 3)
  
  public let rawValue: Int
  public init(rawValue: Int) {
    self.rawValue = rawValue
  }
}

// MARK: - Builder
public class HamburgerBuilder {
  
  public enum Error: Swift.Error {
    case soldOut
  }
  
  public private(set) var meat: Meat = .beef
  public private(set) var sauces: Sauces = []
  public private(set) var toppings: Toppings = []
  
  private var soldOutMeats: [Meat] = [.kitten]
  
  public func addSauces(_ sauce: Sauces) {
    sauces.insert(sauce)
  }
  
  public func removeSauces(_ sauce: Sauces) {
    sauces.remove(sauce)
  }
  
  public func addToppings(_ topping: Toppings) {
    toppings.insert(topping)
  }
  
  public func removeToppings(_ topping: Toppings) {
    toppings.remove(topping)
  }
  
  public func setMeat(_ meat: Meat) throws {
    guard isAvailable(meat) else { throw Error.soldOut }
    self.meat = meat
  }
  
  public func isAvailable(_ meat: Meat) -> Bool {
    return !soldOutMeats.contains(meat)
  }
  
  public func build() -> Hamburger {
    return Hamburger(meat: meat,
                     sauce: sauces,
                     toppings: toppings)
  }
}

// MARK: - Director
public class Employee {
  
  public func createCombo1() throws -> Hamburger {
    let builder = HamburgerBuilder()
    try builder.setMeat(.beef)
    builder.addSauces(.secret)
    builder.addToppings([.lettuce, .tomatoes, .pickles])
    return builder.build()
  }
  
  public func createKittenSpecial() throws -> Hamburger {
    let builder = HamburgerBuilder()
    try builder.setMeat(.kitten)
    builder.addSauces(.mustard)
    builder.addToppings([.lettuce, .tomatoes])
    return builder.build()
  }
}

// MARK: - Example
let burgerFlipper = Employee()

if let combo1 = try? burgerFlipper.createCombo1() {
  print("Nom nom " + combo1.description)
}

if let kittenBurger = try?
  burgerFlipper.createKittenSpecial() {
  print("Nom nom nom " + kittenBurger.description)
  
} else {
  print("Sorry, no kitten burgers here... :[")
}
```
___
## Model-View-View Model (MVVM)

<pre>
ðŸ¥Ž MVVM can be also applied as structural pattern in iOS to separate the UI from the logic.
ðŸ¥Ž This pattern complements MVC well by moving transformation logic out of the view controllers.
</pre>

<img src="./resources/20.png" height="230"/> 

Objects are separated into three distinct groups:
- **Model:** Hold on to app data. Usually structs or simple classes.
- **View:** Views display visual elements on the screen. Usually subclasses of UIView.
- **ViewModel:** Transform model information into values that can be displayed on a view. Usually classes that can be passed as references.

### Considerations
- Use it when transformation of models into view representation is required.
- This is a powerful pattern widely used on real iOS application. Nevertheless, it is highly recommended to use it with other patterns in real applications. 

### Basic Example
The following is a simple example of MVVM pattern, in it we can see how the data to display is obtained in the view model.

```
import PlaygroundSupport
import UIKit

// MARK: - Model
public class PersonalInfo {
    public let birthDate: Date
    init(birthDate: Date) {
        self.birthDate = birthDate
    }
}

// MARK: - ViewModel
public class PersonViewModel {
    private let calendar: Calendar
    private let personalInfo: PersonalInfo
    public init(personalInfo: PersonalInfo,
                calendar: Calendar = Calendar(identifier: .gregorian)) {
      self.personalInfo = personalInfo
      self.calendar = calendar
    }
    
    public var ageText: String {
      let today = calendar.startOfDay(for: Date())
        let birthday = calendar.startOfDay(for: personalInfo.birthDate)
      let components = calendar.dateComponents([.year], from: birthday, to: today)
      let age = components.year!
      return "\(age) years old"
    }
}

extension PersonViewModel {
  public func configure(_ view: PersonView) {
    view.ageLabel.text = ageText
  }
}

// MARK: - View
public class PersonView: UIView {
  public let ageLabel: UILabel
  
  public override init(frame: CGRect) {
    let childFrame = CGRect(x: 0.0, y: 16.0,
                            width: frame.width, height: frame.height / 2)
    ageLabel = UILabel(frame: childFrame)
    ageLabel.textAlignment = .center
    super.init(frame: frame)
    backgroundColor = .white
    addSubview(ageLabel)
  }
  
  @available(*, unavailable)
  public required init?(coder: NSCoder) {
    fatalError("Use init(frame:) instead")
  }
}

// MARK: - Example
let birthday = Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: -2 * 86400 * 366)
let info = PersonalInfo(birthDate: birthday)
let viewModel = PersonViewModel(personalInfo: info)
let frame = CGRect(x: 0.0, y: 0.0, width: 300.0, height: 420.0)
let view = PersonView(frame: frame)
viewModel.configure(view)
PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = view
```
